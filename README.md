# Discord-Bot
 
This is meant to be a discord bot that has multiple different utilities.

The project is currently inactive, as I want to focus on school, and definitely did not have the knowledge (and still don't) to optimize the code and clean it up.

Current implementations include:

Music | Reaction Roles | Welcome | Dynamic Help | Announcements.
